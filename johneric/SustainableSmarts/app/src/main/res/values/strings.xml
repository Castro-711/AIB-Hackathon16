    The goal with this app is to provide
    its users with another means of measuring electricity. A fresh idea that hopes to bridge the gap of
    good old ignorance to an energy people are familiar with. We felt that if we can give users
    an idea of the average physical activity they would have to perform to generate the same
    power as our everyday appliances, we might give them a shock. Pun intended..!
    With the end goal making them more aware and conscious of power they might be wasting.
    We have created a quiz to see if peoples judgement of power usage is as accurate as
    they might think and if not hopefully our app can help align the two. With continued dedication we hope to
    incorporate more ideas and functionality.
